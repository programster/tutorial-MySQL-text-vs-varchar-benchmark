This tool is aims to benchmark the difference between using the TEXT and VARCHAR types in MySQL. It is bundled with a copy of the [Mysql-Syncer](https://github.com/iRAP-software/MySQL-Syncer) tool that this tool wraps around to perform one of its tests. That project is completely separate and its code *may* be different to the bundled version when you read this.

I posted the results of me using this tool in [a post on my blog](https://blog.programster.org/mysql-benchmarking-varchar-vs-text).
